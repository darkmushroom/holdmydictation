The purpose of this simple program is to provide a text window to dictate into for which versions are saved at regular increments.

  - [x] present text window to type into
  - [ ] present UI elements to save, load, and quit
  - [ ] some accelerators would be a nice touch
- [ ] ![](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v321/darkmushroom/Drfetus_small.png) Develop system to save
  - [ ] saving to plaintext is fine at first
  - [ ] saving automatically in increments is pretty important
  - [ ] we should probably do some encryption
- [ ] ![](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v321/darkmushroom/Drfetus_small.png) Further considerations
  * we need bullets and lists in text. Use a symbol or try to stuff bullets into tkinter's Text element?
  * a in-program function for searching and hilighting would be neat
  * providing an interface for saving/loading templates - esp. from a central repository - may be required
